To continue with the integration and ensure the new features work correctly, please perform the following essential step:

1.  **Run `pnpm install`**: Open your terminal in the project's root directory (`C:\dev\cutechat7`) and execute the command:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    This will install all the new dependencies that were added to your `package.json` file during the integration process.

Once the installation is complete, please inform me so I can guide you through the next steps, which may include setting up environment variables or running the application.
